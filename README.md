# ML-Python
Different Prediction Models based on Machine Learning.

This project includes: 
-Using different regression models to predict GDP growth based on given data, prediction of CO2 Emissions of different engines that haven't been tested yet and Churn value of the customers.
-Customer categorisation by their features: age, sex, income, education etc using K-nearest neighbors method.
-Decision Tree model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.
-Support Vector Machine to find out if a human cell is benign or malignant.

This project will be constantly updated with new methods of Machine Learning and datasets.
